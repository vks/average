# average

Calculate statistics of a sequence iteratively in a single pass, using
constant space and avoiding numerical problems. The calculations can be
easily parallelized by using `merge`.

This crate works without `std`.

## Implemented statistics

* Mean and its error.
* Variance, skewness, kurtosis.
* Arbitrary moments.
* Minimum and maximum.
* Quantile.
* Histogram.


## Crate features

The following features are available:

* `libm` enables `Quantile` (using floating point functions provided by `libm`).
  This is enabled by default. If the `std` feature is also enabled, `std` is
  preferred over `libm`.
* `std` enables `Quantile` (using floating point functions provided by `std`).
* `serde1` enables serialization, via Serde version 1.
* `rayon` enables support for `rayon::iter::FromParallelIterator`.
* `nightly` enables the use of const generics for a histogram implementation
  without macros. Note that nightly features are not stable and therefore not
  all library and compiler versions will be compatible.
* `distinct_elements` enables `DistinctElements` to estimate the number of distinct
  elements in a sequence. The implementation is experimental and may suffer breaking changes in a minor release!


## Rust version requirements

Rustc version 1.61 or greater is supported.

  Provides quantile estimates with bounded error but using growing space.
